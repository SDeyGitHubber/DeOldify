# ColorGan

This is a simple web application built using Streamlit that allows users to upload black and white images and automatically colorize them using a deep learning model.

### Features

- Upload Images: Users can upload black and white images in JPG - or PNG format.
- Automatic Colorization: The app uses a pre-trained deep learning model to automatically colorize the uploaded black and white images.
- Interactive Interface: The Streamlit interface provides an interactive and user-friendly experience, allowing users to visualize both the original and colorized images.
