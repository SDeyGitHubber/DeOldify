# ColorGan

This is a simple web application built using Streamlit that allows users to upload black and white images and automatically colorize them using a deep learning model.

### Features

- Upload Images: Users can upload black and white images in JPG - or PNG format.
- Automatic Colorization: The app uses a pre-trained deep learning model to automatically colorize the uploaded black and white images.
- Interactive Interface: The Streamlit interface provides an interactive and user-friendly experience, allowing users to visualize both the original and colorized images.

### Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhruvSanghvi2002/ColorGan.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd ColorGan
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- Open a web browser and go to the provided URL to access the app.

- Upload a black and white image using the file uploader.

- Wait for the colorization process to complete. The colorized image will be displayed alongside the original image.
